    Birth and death are two ends of the bridge of life. The two events need to well documented and preserved to honour lives of indivisuals. These documents are used to avail various benefits and are  a proof of life. In today's selfish world we observe that document is forged and exploited to for their gains. \newline



    We propose a solution used the technology of blockchain which helps providing verified and validated birth and death certificates. Using blockchain makes these certifcates practically immutable and offers persistent storage using ipfs.\newline
    
    We also aim to take the entire process online where the user can apply online and as per traditions the entire power of issuing these certicates rests in the hands of the local bodies of Municipality or Panchayat respectively
