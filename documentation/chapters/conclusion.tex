    \noindent Data immutability, digital signature, tamper-proof and timestamp are the main features of blockchain. It serves as a large public ledger where a node in the network verifies and saves the same data. The process of certificate generation is an open and transparent system where any organization can verify information about any certificate using this system. The advantage of the proposed model is that all the information that is required to validate and authenticate the certificate is hosted on the blockchain itself. In order to validate the certificate, there is no need for external verification or attestation. It is a less time-consuming process with low-cost. It will be further extended to be based on smart contracts. In conclusion, the system helps in eradicating problems of fake certificates.
